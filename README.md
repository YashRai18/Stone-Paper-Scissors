This is my first Git Repository, regarding to Stone-Paper-Scissors game which I built using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 
<br>
This game is based on User vs Computer mode, where the computer generates random options, and also the result will be displayed there itself. Changes that make the code better are welcome.
